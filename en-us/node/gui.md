AntShares.Wallets.MultiSigContract indicates that the address consists of multiple public keys and is a m-of-n multi-signature address, which is used for smart contracts.

(3) Private key: A 256-bit random number, kept by the user and not known publicly, represents the user account ownership and the ownership of the assets within the account.

(4) Public key: Each private key matches to a unique public key (Note: public key, and private key information can be viewed by right clicking on the address.)

![image](http://docs.antshares.org/images/gui/d.png)

(4) Click `OK ', and the wallet will be successfully created, which will come with a standard account, by default. It should be noted that, due to the role of change mechanism, the remainder of the aseets will be transferred to the first address, by default. Thus, there is a need to back up the corresponding private key and wallet.

### Open the wallet database
(1) Everytime the client is re-opened, you will need to click `open wallet database` to select which wallet file to open, as the picture shows: 

![image](http://docs.antshares.org/images/gui/e.png)
